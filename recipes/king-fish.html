      <p>
        These pan-fried kingfish steaks make for a great weeknight dinner. You
        can have them ready on the dinner table in less than 15 minutes. It is
        one reason why we prepare this dish once a week, the other reason being
        that the fish is quite delicious.
      </p>
      <p>
        We like to serve the fish with a tomato sauce, fried onions and mufo.
        All of them can be prepared ahead and the dish can be assembled in a
        very short time. Even though kingfish does not have too many small
        bones, you still need to be cautious when eating.
